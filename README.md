TRACE(halloween) is a branch created by chd from TRACE(master).

Trace is a University of Tennessee digital archive that showcases and preserves published and unpublished works by faculty, departments, programs, research ...</description>

TRAC-1029e to install code to satisfy JIRA Ticket TRAC-1029.

What is the Institutional Repository Project?

The Libraries is currently investigating open source IR systems with the intention to select and implement a new institutional repository platform to replace the hosted Bepress Digtial Commons instance of Trace.

The TRACE project in github is a virtual platform for the DI programmers to investigate the most effective solutions for the IR Project.

This virtual platform should support
 * Creation of a migration plan
 * Determination of hardware requirements
 * An agile software development environment
 * A secure testing environment
 * The ability to demonstrate the look and behavior of the site to our peers outside of the DI programming group
